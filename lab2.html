	<p>The <b>political</b> crisis in <i>Maharashtra</i> continues to unfold as the rebel camp led by Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde floated an idea to form a group named ‘Shiv Sena Balasaheb’ on Saturday, June 23. According to rebel MLA Deepak Vasant Kesarkar, no one from the rebel camp is going to quit Sena or join any other party.


Meanwhile, as rebel MLAs refuse to return to Mumbai, Deputy Speaker of Maharashtra Assembly Narhari Zirwal issued show-cause notices to 16 rebel Sena MLAs for not attending a meeting called upon by Sena Party Whip Sunil Prabhu.</p>
<ol>
	<li>1) Eknath Shinde along with several other Shiv Sena MLAs went incommunicado on June 21. They holed up in a hotel in Surat, Gujarat, a BJP-ruled state. Following this, Shinde was removed as the party's legislative group leader in the Maharashtra assembly.</li>
	<li>2) In the early hours of June 22, 40 MLAs of the Maharashtra Cabinet with 33 from the Shiv Sena arrived in Guwahati along with Eknath Shinde.</li>
	<li>3) Maharashtra Chief Minister amidst speculations that he will resign, said on Wednesday that he is ready to quit if that is what the rebel Shiv Sena MLAs want. Hours after this, Uddhav Thackeray vacated his official residence and moved to his family residence Matoshree in suburban Bandra.</li>
